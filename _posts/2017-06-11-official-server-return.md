We, the P3D Team are proud to announce that our long gone Official P3D Server has just been brought back, for you guys to enjoy!

Now using a new server application (created and actively developed by our staff member Aragas), the server has increased performance, with most old bugs fixed compared to it’s state the last time it was online long ago. (namely the random player dropping and lag issues)

The Official P3D Server is included in the default server list for all P3D game releases so far, but just in the rare case you don’t have it, here is the server info:

Name: The Official Pokémon 3D Server
Address: karp.pokemon3d.net:15124

Feel free to ask any general questions and report any bugs you find regarding the official server in our official discord channel, which you can join by clicking the link below.
